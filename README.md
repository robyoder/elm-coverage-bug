This is a sample project to showcase a couple issues I've been having with https://github.com/zwilias/elm-coverage:

- [Cannot run with non-default tests location](https://github.com/zwilias/elm-coverage/issues/44)
- [Cannot run with locally-installed tools](https://github.com/zwilias/elm-coverage/issues/45)

See the individual branches in this repo for the sample projects.
